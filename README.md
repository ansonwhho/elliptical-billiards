# Geogebra Scripts
This is the repository for GeoGebra simulations that I've played around with. You can find more details on my blog, [Spectroscopy Caf√©](https://spectroscopycafe.github.io), or on my [GeoGebra profile](https://www.geogebra.org/u/spectroscopycafe). 

## Contents
- **Descartes theory of the rainbow**: Shows the mechanism behind rainbow formation from a simple geometric optics perspective. More details on my [blog](https://spectroscopycafe.github.io/light/bites/2021/01/23/rainbows-and-rays.html) or on [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/m/c5bdaahj).

- **Dynamical Billiards**: Visualises what would happen if you were to play billiards on an elliptical table without energy loss. You can find more details about this [here](https://www.geogebra.org/m/euzqtn5p).
